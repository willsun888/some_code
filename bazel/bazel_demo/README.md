# Examples to build C++ code

This package will showcase how to build C++ code in stages.

### Stage 1
The first stage is really simple and shows you how to compile a binary with a single source file.

### Stage 2
The second stage will showcase how to build an application with multiple source and header files, separated in a library and a binary.

### Stage 3
The third stage showcases how to link multiple build directories by building multiple libraries in different packages and then connecting it up with the main application.

### Stage 4

The forth stage showcases how to use **local** external dependencies including Bazel project and non-Bazel project.

### Stage 5

The fifth stage showcases how to use **remote** external dependencies including Bazel project and non-Bazel project.

### Stage 6

The sixth stage showcases how to use .bzl file.

### Stage 7
The seventh stage showcases how to generate cpp protobuf file used by gRPC.

### Stage 8

The eighth stage showcases how to use compile and link option, and build a gRPC hello_client.
